Homework 4

Q1.  Graph 1 is not satisfiable with 3 colors.

Q2.  Graph 1 is satisfiable with 4 colors.

Q3.  Because it was satisfiable with 4 colors and not with three,
     we know that 4 is the minimum number of colors necessary to
     solve this problem.  Any amount of colors greater than 4 simply
     allows for more options and is still solvable.

     The final line of output of RSAT was the following:
     v -1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 -9 10 -11 -12 -13 -14 15 -16 17 -18 -19 -20 -21 22 -23 -24 25 -26 -27 -28 0

     So, if we make a color index of (blue, green, violet, pink) we get:
     	 Node 1: pink
	 Node 2: violet
	 Node 3: green
	 Node 4: violet
	 Node 5: blue
	 Node 6: green
	 Node 7: blue

Q4.  Graph 2 was satisfiable with 8 colors and was unsatisfiable with
     4, 5, 6, and 7 colors.  Therefore, the minimum number of colors
     required to properly color our graph is 8.
